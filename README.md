It is an academic project completed during the third year of Bachelor in Economics and Management.  
Analysis of Bitcoin’s price determinants using multiple regression and an ARIMA model in R.  

## Relevance  
- Demonstrates how an unconventional asset can be studied with classical econometric tools.  
- Highlights Bitcoin’s uniqueness: volatility, exogenous shocks, mimetic behaviors.  
- Shows its increasing integration into traditional financial markets.  

## Limitations and critical review  
- Conducted at undergraduate level  
- Monthly data limits insights into microstructure.  
- The variable are restricted: institutional flows, technological innovations, and regional regulations should be added.  
- Linear modeling often insufficient for a non-stationary, speculative asset like Bitcoin.  

## Outlook  
Now as a Master’s student in Finance, I see this project as a first step toward more advanced quantitative analysis of emerging financial assets.
